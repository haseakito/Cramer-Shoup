# Cramer-Shoup
Java implementation of Cramper Shoup cryptosystem

Proposed and developed by Ronald Cramer and Victor Shoup in 1998, the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem is a key encryption algorithm first to be proven secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack without a random oracle. Though it originates from the ElGamal cryptosystem, the Cramer-Shoup system adds other elements and additional calculations to ensure security against a resourceful attacker.
